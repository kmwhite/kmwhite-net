:summary: New blog rebuild. Starting over.
:tags: pelican

Well, here it is. The great rebuild of the blog, iteration-n. New projects,
new employment, new perspectives. Given that I had so many "new" things
going on, rebuilding the blog felt applicable, even though I've always
struggled to maintain one of these stupid things.

Starting over is always nice. Yes, even as a self-professed "Oscar the Grouch
of Web-Development", I enjoy starting over. I hate the tedium that comes with
repeating boilerplate tasks to set up a new environment and/or project, but
as former coworker of mine pointed out, it is a good time to re-evaluate. It
allows us a chance to clean up and revamp some old habits that we have accrued
over time; a time to remove the bad habits that you've acquired over time.

In my most recent switch over, I've gone from doing Ruby on a day-to-day
basis to doing Python and Django. Anyone who knows me knows that I didn't
have a lot of love for Rails; I found it too... encumbering (which is
weird as fuck since everything was so "magical"). It may have been that I 
had been doing it for a decade and no longer felt like I was growing or it
could have been that I simply didn't like it. Regardless, it was time to
move on.

Starting off a project in Python was interesting. I was able to release a
Pyramid_ based app, and then, in order to launch the next one, decided to
take a stab at a Django_ one. The choices and switch were deliberate, but
twice I got to "start over". Starting over means you have to learn a quick
crash course on the project, then take apart things to get the specifics,
finally getting to a point where you feel comfortable. Until then, you're
often just struggling to move forward, looking for the pieces that make
sense of the plethora of new tools.

I decided to reboot this old haunt because I wanted a place to post all the
notes I made for the new projects, but I also wanted to help someone.. maybe.
As a seasoned engineer that has failed gloriously_ and eeked out the occasional
success, I know something about feeling lost. I've started enough projects that
I know how to take something on, completely outside my wheel house, and move
forward. Maybe someone will find use in these notes.

For the blog, I chose to go with Pelican_ and the kept same repo_. It supports
python 3.6, the same language I use at my day job, and took close to no work
getting up and running. 

Next stop, buildroot_ and Nerves_ on the XU4_.
