Title: This is my dog. There are many like him, but this one is mine.

I’m doing this post because I’m probably going to have to put him down tomorrow. This is the most difficult thing I remember feeling, so I figured I’d brag about him.

March of my freshman year in high-school, my parents came home with a Sheltie pup. We were going over to my grandparents house because my grandfather was dying of cancer. The entire night I held that puppy and pet him. Over time, I grew to love him. We already had a dog in the household, but he could be “mine”.

The other dog, Gizmo, a half-sheltie half-poodle mix, was the families dog, but she showed a clear preference, loyalty, and obedience to my older sister. I always considered it hers. The dog took to her, slept by her, and I wanted a connection like that.

I brushed him, fed him, and raised him. I don’t take full credit as I was only 14. My parents did a lot of the work too. Hell, even Gizmo chipped in for some training time, but that was motherly instincts I’m guessing. I didn’t think he’d wind up being ‘my’ dog, but then it happened.

I was taking the garbage out one day. Our cans were in the back of the house along the driveway which was shared with our neighbor. My neighbors dog didn’t like me. Or my dad, for that matter. It was a nice dog, but unless you were a male that wasn’t a member of that family. Anyway, today was the day. It bit me while walking the garbage out. Latched right onto my calf. Well, it tried to, anyway, Miller didn’t like this. At all. He happened to be out at the same time and tore after the neighbors dog (Ginger). Miller was also on the leash, but he didn’t let that stop him. The little 25 pound sheltie snapped the metal ring on his collar (solid, not a keychain-type that the chains go on) and launched after Ginger.

We should note, Ginger wasn’t small. She was a mix, but the German Sheppard in her was pretty obvious. Within a blink of an eye to me, Miller had taken out Ginger. Literally body slammed her, dropped down and started snarling. When she came for seconds, he grabbed onto her neck with his jaw and fended her off. The neighbor came out yelling at me, but frankly I saw no problem with what just happened. We separated the dogs and went back inside. That night, Miller slept at the foot of my bed. He was mine.

Fast forward a couple years and Gizmo is reaching 15 years of age. She’s sick, and not going to make it. Miller is only 4 now. I’m at work, and my parents are upstairs. Gizmo is actively dying. Miller opens my door gets pillows from the couch and a blanket and brings them to Gizmo. Put a pillow under her, a blanket over her and looked out for her. He dragged water bowls to her and groomed her until she passed. I wouldn’t believe the story if my parents hadn’t had heard what was going on and went down to look. Gizmo passed, surrounded by family, and her “son” taking care of her.

Not to long after that, I awake to one of the foulest smells I can remember. Miller is sick and had an accident. Terrified, I head upstairs and my parents take us to the vet. Bad news. Miller has [ulcerative colitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis). Good news, he’s treatable. He’s going to be okay.

Fast forward another year, we’re moving. I never really had friends where I was (good [as in close] ones, at least), but now we were moving 30 or so miles south. For the next few years, Miller was all I knew of for a friend. He slept on my bed. I cleaned up after him when he’d have breakthroughs of the disease and he’d stay with me while I was miserable. Eventually I made some friends (I got three now :P), but no one could compare to the relationship I had with him.

Eventually I started dating like normal people do. Miller would express his feelings on the girls to me. First girl I dated, he walked up to, smelled her, peed on her feet, and walked away. I wish I had gotten the hint then. Thanks anyway, Miller. You had good insight.

A few more years go by and I feel the same way. I’m working a new job now, and moved in with my (new) girlfriend, but Miller is still a core part of who I am.

When my mother had Liver failure, my gf took care of him, and he took to her too (in fact, she’s the first one he didn’t pee on). Still loving and supportive, the dog would be there.

Another year goes by and we’re at current day. Miller is 11 now. I take him out and he has trouble going to the bathroom. That’s weird, I think. He has colitis. Difficulty going to the bathroom is pretty much the opposite of what I’m used to seeing. I give him a day to get better and when he doesn’t we go into the vet. Doc thinks he’s just sick at first and after some treatment, he starts getting better. While examining, however, the doc found a tiny nodule on Miller’s prostate. Now, there was some confusion because Miller is fixed, but he was fixed late. Doc says we’ll schedule another exam in a week to allow him to get better. We don’t get through the week.

Thinking it was just a virus, I had gotten on a plane to see the GF and her family in Arizona. Miller was at my parents new house with family. I gave my parents a credit card of mine and said if ANYTHING happens take him in and call me. He should be ok because of the meds, but this is my dog. I’m not willing to gamble. The day after I land I get a call. It’s cancer.

The nodule was like the tip of an iceberg. And it wasn’t just the prostate. Much like in human males, prostate cancer didn’t show symptoms until the end. It’s in his lungs, gallbladder, and liver now. He has a general weakness to him which we aren’t sure if it is yet another metastization (sp?) point, or just pain from his condition. In the past week, I’ve watched my best friend go from being a happy-go-lucky mutt who will play fetch with you for over 4 hours to a shell of what he used to be.

He currently rejects food, water, and his toys. He has difficulty walking and going to the bathroom. Medications are no longer helping. I’ve discussed surgery and chemo with the doc, but currently things look bleak. Vomitting and incontenance have set in.

The most painful thing I can think of is putting him down. For the past 11 years, he’s been my best friend. For most of that, my only friend. I can’t watch this happen to him, and I don’t know what else we can do. I love him and a painful death isn’t acceptable. I don’t want him to hurt.

I beg of you all, please be good to your pets. This is horrible.
