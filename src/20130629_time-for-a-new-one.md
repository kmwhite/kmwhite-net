Well, that didn't work. I gave up. On top of everything else going on, my TJ's transmission went out. Given this was my daily driver, it was time to move on (I would have kept working if it was just a project car). Enter a 2013 Jeep Wrangler JK (2-Door, the way they're meant to be made). Hopefully, this will be a better trip![zombie eager](/images/eager.gif)
