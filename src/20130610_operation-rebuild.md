Title: Operation Rebuild: Restoring The TJ (Part I)
Category: jeep
Tags: jeep

### The Story
I semi-recently acquired a TJ ('02 Sport, 6 cylinder, 4.0L, auto-trans). It was used and I'm fairly certain the previous owner sucked at life.

### The Problem
I had a problem where it started dropping RPMs at idle and sometimes stalling out -- to keep it running, I had to hold the brake and rev the engine to 1K RPMs when at stop signs and lights. Using the odo trick to read the ECU, I saw a `P0320`. I brought it in and got the Crankshaft Positioning Sensor replaced. While they were working on it, I had them do a tuneup (they replaced the plugs and cleaned the throttle-body), replace the trans fluid, and check for other problems (they said the water pump is leaking) for a mere $400. After getting it back, it seemed fine so I took a 250mi road trip. During the trip, my MIL flashed. I stopped and pulled `P0300` (Random Misfire), `P0304` (Random Misfire Cylinder 4), `P0305` (Random Misfire Cylinder 5), and `P0306` (Random Misfire Cylinder 6) from the ECU. [Some](http://www.jeepforum.com) [research](http://www.wranglerforum.com) showed that Jeeps hate non-Mopar sensors.

That was the last time I brought the TJ to anyone. I went out, got a [Haynes manual](http://www.amazon.com/Wrangler-Haynes-Repair-Manual-1987-2008/dp/B0002JMHYG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1370917101&sr=8-1&keywords=haynes+repair+manual+jeep), and started working on it myself.

I have since replaced the off-brand TPS and MAP sensors with Mopar ones. I replaced the CKP with one of [these](http://www.jeep4x4center.com/crankshaft-positioning-sensor-4-0l-4897321aa.html) because I couldn't find a Mopar one anywhere for my Jeep. I also cleaned up the IAC as much as I could and did another pass on the Throttle Body as per [this](http://www.jeepforum.com/forum/f9/cleaning-iac-throttle-body-write-up-dummies-1114849/) post. She runs a hell of a lot better seeing as now I can accelerate again, but I still get infrequent low RPM idles. When it happens, there us usually a sudden, rough vibration and it returns to a normal-ish (stable, but I get the feeling it should be higher) 600-700 RPM. Additionally, during acceleration, the tachometer will spike (up as high as 4000-4500 RPMs). It does it in every gear. When it happens, the car surges forward.

### Ideas
What should I do? My current thoughts are to change the transmission fluid and buying new spark plugs (effectively doing everything that has been done to it again, but with quality parts). I never worked on a car before this. I don't even know if I'm dealing with one problem or two. I'm about 4000 miles into my oil, so I should probably just up and change that too. Maybe I need to replace an O2 sensor? I haven't gotten any new fault codes, but I did get a test failure: `TID: $11 CID: $01` according to [Torque](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.prowl.torque&hl=en)

*sigh* And the more I work on it, the more attached to it I get. I hope to God this wasn't a lost cause.
