## Hello World, from Pelican

I just switched over to [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/) to host my website. Two years behind the curve? Sure. That sounds like me. I did it because I wanted simple. There are tons of guides out there:

 * [Pelican: a static blog generator for Pythonistas](http://fjavieralba.com/pelican-a-static-blog-generator-for-pythonistas.html)
 * [Pelican, a simple static blog generator in python](http://blog.notmyidea.org/pelican-a-simple-static-blog-generator-in-python.html)
 * [Generate blog with Pelican and Markdown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWjPMlXNLTw)

Also, once generate, I could host on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/), and I fucking love Heroku. There is a helpful post by [Kennith Reitz](http://kennethreitz.com/static-sites-on-heroku-cedar.html) on using static pages with Heroku. After that, it is just a matter of [pointing your DNS at your new app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains) and you are good to go.
