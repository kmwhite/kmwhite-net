Title: Operation Rebuild: Restoring Veronica (Part II)

Tags: jeep, veronica

I was asking around [Jeepit](http://www.reddit.com/r/jeep) about my issues and received a great response from [nothinginit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jeep/comments/1g3caj/idle_problems_acceleration_problems_need_advice/caiblhi).

It started me off thinking.  I took her out for a few drives to gauge her behavior. The idle stumble is significantly better since I did the most recent sensor replacements. It happened maybe once in my 45min drive. To tackle that, I ordered a new O<sub>2</sub> sensor. I'll install that, before trying the other solutions suggested by /u/nothinginit, given the test results output from Torque.

As for the RPM spike, I added running on cruise control to the test drive -- it didn't spike while doing it. It only seems to spike when I'm actually attempting to accelerate. From a stopped position, when I push down on the gas, the car picks up and moves fine. About half the time, it has a quick spike in RPMs and then bucks forward and starts moving. When driving, and pushing down to increase my speed to pass another vehicle, the RPMs spike and it almost feels like I'm in neutral, but the car picks up speed after the short hesitation. The sudden spike causes a rough ride that wasn't there before I brought it in. ![angry](/static/images/angry.gif)

The thing that confuses me the most about this is that I didn't have any of these problems until I had the crappy CKP in the car and got the misfires. Since I replaced the CKP, it has gotten a lot better, but still isn't *right*. Should I be looking for a Mopar one to finish improving it?

I also took a look at the plugs. They are gapped to 0.035" and are [Champion RC12ECC](http://www.championsparkplugs.com/Quickwatch.aspx?zpid=8519) plugs. Interestingly, I didn't see the little crushable gaskets on them. I picked six [Autolite APP985](http://shop.advanceautoparts.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_double-platinum-spark-plug-autolite_15650025-p?vehicleIdSearch=147591&isAllVehicle=false)s. I was debating just swapping them for the hell of it and see if it helps. I figure the miles of misfires were probably bad for the plugs that are in there.

Does that make sense, actually? The new CKP is reading correctly, but the damage done to the existing plugs by the repeated misfires is causing the odd behavior? I guess new plugs couldn't hurt -- and if anything, rule that out. I had difficulty getting to all the plugs, but that was due to difficulties removing the ignition coil. I hate all the little plugs with their red pull tabs then black depression tabs. I can never get the buggers off.

If those don't work, I guess I'll replace the CPS and then look for a full function scan tool to borrow. Also, I'll have to start checking my hoses. I have the FSM, so I guess I'll try and track those down.

On a side note, I have two notes about this endeavour: 

* I enjoy that two months ago, I didn't know how **ANYTHING** in the car worked. If nothing else, this is a great learning experience.

* Parking in a closed garage, with a recently driven engine, in 92&deg;F heat and humidity, is **HOT**. ![dead](/static/images/dead.gif) Don't do it again...


**UPDATE (2013-06-16)**
After letting the engine cool over night, I went and changed the plugs. It improved the ride by about 30%. It turns out that they incorrectly gapped the three plugs that were misfiring (the plugs were at 0.030"). Smoother, but still needs some love. Hopefully the O<sub>2</sub> and Camshaft Positioning sensors will fix the last of it.
