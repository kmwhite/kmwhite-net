Title: And I rolled it. That was quick.

The girlfriend and I went camping with her family at [The Badland](http://www.badlandsoffroad.com/). I finally got to go `Jeeping`. It was great. The first trip out on the trails was great. I pulled up next to a couple (husband and wife, both with their own rigs). As a group, we toured the first five miles of the trail.

It was on our second time on the trail (and off the road, *ever*) that I took the damage. We were driving through a bit of water (I walked through it and measured with a stick, about 8in deep) with half the wheels in the mud and hit a dip (about 24in) in the ground I missed when checking it beforehand. We rolled right over onto the side. No injuries (yay for seatbelts and the roll cage). We put supports under the wheels on their side and got it up right. One of the other individuals on the trails, not a part of the first group we went out with, is a mechanic for Jeep/Chrystler and gave it a quick once-over. I need an alignment for damn sure, but mostly unscathed; Got us the 100+ mi home without a hiccup.

I feel the need to point out how cool everyone was. I expected some flak for rolling onto the side, but the staff got it up and joked around with me. Even suggest getting a lift and some 35s, then coming back. Awesome people. Love the Jeeper community.
