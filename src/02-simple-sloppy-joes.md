Category: cooking
Tags: beef, sandwich, simple

Trying to make a quick dinner, I wound up with a simple Sloppy Joe recipe I don't want to forget:

### The Ingredients
 * 1lb Ground Beef
 * 1 small chopped onion
 * 5 cloves of minced garlic
 * 2 tsp Worceshire Sauce
 * 3/4 cup ketchup
 * 1 tsp paprika
 * salt to taste
 * pepper to taste
 * maple seasoning to taste

### The Steps

 1. Brown the ground beef, onion, and garlic in a frying pan (**medium** heat)
 2. Drain the juices
 3. Mix in the seasonings into the beef and vegetables
 4. Simmer on **low** heat for 25-30 minutes
 5. Serve

The dish serves four, or two hungry individuals. ;) Goes great with macaroni and cheese.
