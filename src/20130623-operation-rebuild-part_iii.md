Title: Operation Rebuild: Restoring Veronica (Part III)
Category: jeep
Tags: jeep, veronica

I wound up replacing the upstream O<sub>2</sub> sensors with a pair NTK sensors ([23139 - Upstream Front](http://www.amazon.com/NGK-23139-Oxygen-Sensor/dp/B001PNCNF6/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=1EV3RFL0WFFPY&coliid=I6E65IXSQSEJZ), [23138 - Upstream Back](http://www.amazon.com/NGK-23138-Oxygen-Sensor/dp/B001PNCLHQ/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=1EV3RFL0WFFPY&coliid=I2S8JGTHURIVHA)). I chose NTKs because they were the subcontracted manufacturer for the parts when Jeep made my TJ. They were also significantly cheaper, and had the Jeep Forums Seal of Approval&trade;. 

Seriously, however, they increased my gas milage from about 8mpg to 17mpg.  Hell of an improvement. I still need to replace my downstream sensors, but I'm happy with the outcome of this. My idle problems are just about gone. My revving issue, however, is still there. I managed to capture some output from Torque when driving. I'm still comparing all the high RPM instances to determine what is going on. Oh well. I've got progress!
